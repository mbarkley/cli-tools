cli-tools
=========

A collection of CLI tools for performing mundane tasks:

* **mkpdir**: will move java source files in a flat directory into the proper package folder structure.

* **mvn-stress-test**: runs a given set of maven goals a given number of times (or until failure). Useful for reproducing sporadic build/test failures.
